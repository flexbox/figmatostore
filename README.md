## Notes

This setup has inspiration from [examples/with-tailwindcss](https://github.com/zeit/next.js/blob/canary/examples/with-tailwindcss/README.md). This example will show you how to integrate [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) with [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

`tailwindcss.macros` is used to add tailwind classes inside Emotion by injecting the tailwind CSS into the styled component. No need to use CSS files, autoprefix, minifier, etc. You will get the full benefits of Emotion.

The CSS classes generated by Emotion will include the tailwind styles but not the name of the classes. For example the following component:

```jsx
const Header = styled.div`
  ${tw`font-mono text-sm text-gray-800`}
`
```

Will be transformed into:

```css
.css-25og8s-Header {
  font-family: Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', 'Courier New',
    monospace;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  color: #2d3748;
}
```
